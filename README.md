# DataCompass

DataCompass is our GovHack 2025 project: an AI-powered search engine for Australian government data.

## Overview

The frontend is built in **Next.js**, designed with a clean UI that resembles ChatGPT for natural language queries.  
The backend is written in **Python**, which connects to the **ABS API**, processes results, and uses the **OpenAI API** to summarize and present the information clearly.

## Features

- Ask questions in plain English
- Discover datasets from ABS and other agencies
- Get summaries and simple charts
- Direct links to the original data sources

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install && npm run dev` in `/frontend`
3. Run `python app.py` in `/backend`

## Goal

Make government data easy to find, understand, and use.
